# 4020DeviceNetworks
In Device Networks, we used a BeagleBone Black running its own API. Our backend server running on Visual Studio's Windows Forms App made API calls to the board to collect its GPS position and light level. The purpose of this project was to drive around and collect data points on where it is too dark on campus.
